////Collaboration and sources 
I talked with multiple of my classmates for help and had chat gpt explain to me what all the functions of chat gpt was doing. I had planed to go to Regina's office hours on Sunday but by that time I had figured out 
what my bug in my code was. 

//Implementation details 
Learning filesystem was quite a trip for me, but once I got it done it was a bit easier. I have been kind of rusty on file streams. Doing read word was pretty easy for the most part until checking if the comma was
inside of the function. Other than that, pretty chill. 


////Testing status 
Fully functional and no output on blue
