////Collaboration and sources 
I talked with multiple of my classmates for help and had chat gpt explain to me what all the functions of chat gpt was doing. I had planed to go to Regina's office hours on Sunday but by that time I had figured out 
what my bug in my code was. 

//Implementation details 
Learning filesystem was quite a trip for me, but once I got it done it was a bit easier. I have been kind of rusty on file streams. Doing read word was pretty easy for the most part until checking if the comma was
inside of the function. Other than that, pretty chill. 


////Testing status 
Fully functional and no output on blue

Part 2
////Collaboration and sources 
I talked with my classmates and did use chatgpt to help me with one constructor for the priority queue. I was struggling alot on that one and I was very very confused as to what to do. 

//Implementation details
Binary search tree was a breeze to get through, the priority queue wasn't. I didn't understand how to make the treenode work so I just made a seperate h file to make it easier for myself. In hindsight, I could have
just done something similar to the private structure of the tree node like in the bst file, but they do essentially the same thing.

///Testing status

I don't know if it works on blue currrently, I know it works on clion but unfortunately I didn't make enough time to check on there so I'm hoping it works. If it doesn't then that will be something I will have to fix in the final part of the project.
